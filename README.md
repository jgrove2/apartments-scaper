# Apartments.com Scraper
The apartments.com scraper is given a url for a outlined area from apartments.com and over the course of time that it is running it will scrape and update the user on new apartments that appear fitting the description they want. If a new apartment appears it will send a message to a discord channel. The user can also ask to view all apartments currently listed that fit their description.
